My name is Shican, friends also call me Claire. This is where I tell my friends too much about myself:

I'm a researcher with a Ph.D. in Biology from Georgetown University. 

- I have 10+ years of experience in biological research and am particularly enthusiastic about inter-disciplinary research!
- I excel at teaching undergraduate lab lectures in my Ph.D. program.
- My favorite work break is to create art projects, since I don't have many travel vacation time being a Ph.D. student.
- I kept a science outreach blog and was selected as a VIP KOL on a lifestyle platform targeting global Chinese expats.
- PS: if you see this, that means I just self-learned website-building! 

Please find more about my past research, data processing pipelines, student comments on my teaching, my sample blogs, and sample art pieces in the link below. Or you can visit them by clicking the navigation bar above! What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
