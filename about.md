Hi! I’m Shican, a self-proclaimed science nerd with a passion for integrating physics and bioinformatics into cell biology. When I’m not busy cracking the mysteries of cells under a microscope, you can find me teaching, painting, or blogging. Here's more about my adventures in science and beyond!

💼 With 10 years of experience in cell culture-based research, I’ve also honed my skills in bioinformatics, microscopy, geospatial point pattern analysis, and rheological analysis. My past projects span biophysics and chemical biology. Curious about my research and data processing pipelines? [Check them out here](......).

🎓 I earned my Ph.D. in Biology from Georgetown University under the guidance of the amazing [Heidi Elmendorf](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RdOCAA0/heidi-elmendorf). Before that, I conducted research at Brandeis University in the incredible [Hedstrom lab](https://sites.google.com/brandeis.edu/hedstromlab/). I also conducted organic synthesis for my undergraduate honors thesis with the nicest [Professor Cirillo](https://www.newhaven.edu/faculty-staff-profiles/pier-cirillo.php).

👩🏻‍🏫 I excel at teaching! I’ve taught 4 biochemistry lab lectures and a genetics lab lecture during my Ph.D. program and even managed all biochemistry lab sessions for a semester. [See what my students thought about my classes here](...).

🌎 I run a science outreach blog and have been selected as a Key Opinion Leader on a lifestyle platform for global Chinese expats.[Check out some of my top articles on The Science of Acquiring Mental Wellness, The Science in Vaccines, and The Science in Perfumery here](......).

❤️ When I’m not in the lab, I unwind with art therapy. (Who still doesn't know that Ph.D. students don’t get much vacation time?) [Explore some of my hobby paintings and opera performance pictures here](........).

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
