I’m Shican, a self-proclaimed science nerd with a passion for integrating physics and bioinformatics into cell biology. When I’m not busy cracking the mysteries of cells under a microscope, you can find me teaching, painting, or blogging. Here's more about my adventures in science and beyond!


### 💼 Research Experience
- **10 years** of experience in **cell culture**-based research.
- Skilled in **bioinformatics, microscopy, geospatial point pattern analysis,** and **fluid rheological analysis**.
- Past projects in **biophysics** at Georgetown and **biochemistry** at Brandeis.
- Curious about my research and data processing pipelines? [Check them out here](/research).

### 🎓 Education
- **Ph.D. in Biology** from **Georgetown** University under the guidance of the [amazing Heidi Elmendorf](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RdOCAA0/heidi-elmendorf).
- **M.S.** research at **Brandeis** University in the incredible [Hedstrom lab](https://sites.google.com/brandeis.edu/hedstromlab/).
- Conducted organic synthesis for my undergraduate honors thesis with the nicest [Professor Cirillo](https://www.newhaven.edu/faculty-staff-profiles/pier-cirillo.php).

### 👩🏻‍🏫 Teaching Highlights
- Taught **4 biochemistry lab lectures** and a **genetics lab lecture** during my Ph.D. program.
- Managed all biochemistry lab class sessions offered by the department for a semester (2 sessions with around 60 students).
- [See what my students thought about my classes here](/teaching).

### 🌎 Science Outreach
- Run a science outreach blog.
- Selected as a **Key Opinion Leader** on a lifestyle platform for global Chinese expats.
- [Check out some of my top articles](/blog) on The Science of Acquiring Mental Wellness, The Science in Vaccines, and The Science in Perfumery.
  
### ❤️ Hobbies
- When I’m not in the lab, I unwind with **art therapy**. (Who still doesn't know that Ph.D. students don’t get much vacation time?)
- [Explore some of my hobby paintings and opera performance pictures here](/art).
