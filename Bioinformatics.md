### Introduction

One of the chapters of my dissertation research aims to employ a bioinformatic approach to gain a deeper understanding of how _Giardia_ responds to mucus-like mechanical stresses at the transcriptome level. This involves examining the cellular machinery changes _Giardia_ employs to overcome these mechanical stresses.

### RNA Sequencing

I conducted RNA sequencing on _Giardia_ trophozoites under different conditions, each with varying degrees of viscoelasticity. Analyzing the RNAseq data provided valuable insights, forming the basis for the third chapter of my dissertation and a draft journal article.

### Bioinformatics Skills and Tools

Beyond the findings related to my research questions, the experience of using command line tools, Google HPC, and programming languages to analyze, manage, and manipulate biological big data was mesmerizing. I fell in love with the process of analyzing big data, experimenting with code, and quickly obtaining results. The abundance of online resources allowed me to continuously learn new techniques, analysis methods, and gain a deeper understanding of bioinformatics.

### Continuous Learning and Adaptation

Every research has different experimental plans and model organisms, I often had to search for new analysis and statistical methods, adapting pipelines and techniques. This constant need for innovation kept me motivated and engaged, ensuring I never felt bored! I love this feeling!

### Data Visualization

In addition to command line tools for data transfer and automation, I further enhanced my data visualization skills. I am keen on finding the most effective graphical representations for my results, ensuring they are color blindness friendly and publication ready. Below are examples of 3D graphs, contour maps, and heatmaps I created to represent data involving multiple variables:

### Principal Component Analysis and Other Visualizations

Here is an example of Principal Component Plots, which help discover data clustering in up to ten dimensions:

Additionally, here is an example of volcano plot, revealing differentially expressed genes:

And here is a heatmap from one of my experiments, displaying RNAseq data of cells in three different conditions:
