Welcome to my little corner, Asteroid B-678! 🪐

I'm Shican, but friends call me Claire. I recently graduated with a Ph.D. in biology from Georgetown University. Before you click away thinking it's all serious and science-y here, let me tell you why you should stick around!

Ever wondered what it's like to blend physics and biology in the lab🔬, teach with passion, or transform complex data into stunning visuals? Or maybe you're curious about my artsy side👩‍🎨 or my influencer blog that fuses science with lifestyle tips?

Well, don't just take my word for it. Head to the [**About**](about) page to dive in. I promise I won't overshare like I do with my friends.
