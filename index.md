Welcome to my little Asteroid B-678! 🪐

I'm Shican, friends also call me Claire. I recently graduated with a Ph.D.🎓 in biology from Georgetown University. Before you click away thinking it's all serious and science-y here, let me tell you why you should stick around!

Ever wondered what it's like to blend physics ⚛️ and biology 🔬 in the lab, teach with passion🦉, or transform experimental data into stunning visuals🌌 Or maybe you're curious about my artsy side👩‍🎨 or my influencer blog that fuses science with lifestyle tips🏄🏼‍♂️?

Well, don't just take my word for it. Head to the [**About**](about) page to dive in. I promise I won't overshare like I do with my friends.

P.S.: If you see this, it means I taught myself website building. Ready? Let's go!
