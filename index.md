My name is Shican, my friends also call me Claire. Here is what I tell my firends too much about myself:
I'm a life science researcher with a Ph.D. from Georgetown University. I have 10+ year of experience in biological research and particullarlly highly enthusiastic in inter-disciplinary research!


- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
