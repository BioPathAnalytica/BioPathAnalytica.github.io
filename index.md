---

My name is Shican, my friends also call me Claire. Here is what I tell my firends too much about myself:
I'm a life science researcher with a Ph.D. from Georgetown University. 

- I have 10+ year of experience in biological research and particullarlly highly enthusiastic in inter-disciplinary research!
- I rock at teaching undergraduate lab lectures in my Ph.D. program.
- My favorate work break is to create art projects, since I don't have many travel vaction time being a Ph.D. student.
- I kept a science outreach blog and was selected as a VIP KOL on a life style platform targeting Global Chinese expacts.
- ps: if you see this, that means I just self-learned website-building! 

Please find more about my past research, data processing piplines, student comments on my teaching, my sample blogs and sample art pieces in the link below. Or you can visit them by clicking the navigation bar above!

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
